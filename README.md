# MCT Project

This is the MCT project which was assigned to me, the original website is Monogram consoles and Modules and I developed exactly same UI as possible
with HTML, core CSS and TailwindCSS. 

As a beginner at some sections I have used the CSS Framework ie.., TailwindCSS to get hands-on knowledge about the language

The logo for this project I have created by myself using paint software

In HTML I have mostly used Semantic tags like <section> <article> <footer> <strong> and so on to get better SEO

In CSS I have used the properties like positions, z-index, backgroung-image, dropdown menu and so on..

I tried my best to make this UI responsive and more I was gaining knowledgwe to make websites Responsive 

I have used fontawesome for icons like social media links
